# Coding-1-Final
 These are the starter files for S2021 Coding 1
I didn’t change anything in the navbar except for the new logo I put in. For the carousel I kept a similar theme of pictures and put in pictures of nature. For the footer I did a simple three column footer with the link and the school’s name and address. On the contact page I put a three column div with my email, phone number, and mailing address with links to email me or call me. On the about page I put a picture of me with a caption describing the picture and the paragraph describing me in a two column div.
